## Introduction

CarSystem is an innovative platform designed to calculate and track insurance rates based on real-time driving activities. The system dynamically adjusts the user's insurance premium based on factors like speed, distance traveled, braking habits, and overall driving behavior. It also provides insights into how safe driving can lower insurance costs.

With CarSystem, users can monitor their driving performance and receive real-time feedback on how it impacts their insurance rates, offering a more personalized and adaptive experience compared to traditional insurance models.
